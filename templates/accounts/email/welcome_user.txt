Welcome to the PyCon Latam Program Committee Talk Review!

When you're ready to get started, please log in at https://vote.pylatam.org.

At that website you will see a talk proposal, chosen randomly from the pool of
proposals that have the least reviews so far.

Thank you so much for your help in making this year's PyCon Latam program--we can't do
it without your time and thoughtful input. We hope you have fun reading these
talk proposals!
