Welcome to the PyCon Latam Program Committee Talk Review!

When you're ready to get started, please log in at http://progcom.njl.us/. 

At that website you will see a talk proposal, chosen randomly from the pool of
proposals that have the least reviews so far.

Right now we are in the screening stage of talk proposal evaluation.

We talk about proposals on a slack channel; you should receive an invite to the
slack at https://pylatam.slack.com/ shortly.

Thank you so much for your help in making this year's PyCon Latam program--we can't do
it without your time and thoughtful input. We hope you have fun reading these
talk proposals!
